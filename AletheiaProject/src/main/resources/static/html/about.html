	<h1>About Us</h1>

	<p>We are Aletheia, an application that was made to help our users
		to find amazing places to visit and take pictures. Our main objective
		is provide our users an space to share all that places.</p>

	<h2>How We Started</h2>

	<p>We started doing this project with some ideas, the most
		important of them is that we want we want to provide a space where the
		user can enjoy the best places in the city, and in turn provide a
		reality that can be shared with other users of the app, and is also
		complemented by the value we want to convey that it is to show what is
		hidden, to show what is true, that place that should be visible to the
		eyes of the whole world.</p>

	<h2>What Is Aletheia</h2>

	<p>Well the idea comes out from the necessity of not having any App
		that will give all the functionalities all together. On one side we
		have Instagram that allows us as users to post content to our profile,
		Google shows us how to arrive at different places and Snapchat shows
		us a map with different locations. However, none of them have it all
		in one, so Aletheia does that, it shows you the best locations to take
		pictures and also how to arrive there and see in the map if the other
		users are in the same location.</p>

	<h2>Our Valors and Beliefs</h2>

	<p>We do this project because we want to provide a space where the
		user can enjoy the best places in the city, and at the same time
		provide a reality that can be shared with other users of the app, in
		addition to being complemented by the value that we want to transmit
		that it is to show what is hidden, to show what is true, that place
		that should be visible to the eyes of the whole world.</p>

	<h2>For Our Users</h2>

	<p>Our customers will enjoy from different funcionalities as taking
		photos on beatiful places plus uploading the location of the site.
		With this is possible that another users can use the same place to
		make turism or taking photos. Aletheia wants to be original and
		supportive, with that, we want our customer to be themselves in our
		platform an share thei photos, places and hobbies.</p>
